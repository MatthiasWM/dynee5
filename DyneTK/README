
Proof of concept, part 3

This version of the Dyne Toolkit can compile scripts, create
a package, send it to the Newton and run it there. 

This version WILL crash a lot! I also take no responsibility
whatsoever to what may happen to your Newton or PC.

This is how you can test it:

- unpack this zip archive
- run ntk2d.exe
- click on the Inspector Toolbox in the bottom left and start
  the toolkit on the Newton (default port if COM1:, but you 
  can change that in the Toolkit settings). The connection
  is established if both toolboxes on the Newton and in DyneTK 
  remain open
- in the main menu, click on Project->Load Project and choose 
  "Aloha.ntk"
- we have no layout editor yet, so you will get a text editor 
  with "Aloha.txt" inside instead
- Type Ctrl-1 to compile the code and build the package. This 
  takes only a second, but no 'done' message is sent. If there
  was a syntax error, you will get a very brief message in the 
  terminal
- Type Ctrl-2 to download you newly created package to the 
  Newton. There are still flaws in the protocol and this download
  may hickup, but if it doesn't, the red LED will revert to green
  and continue flashing every 3 seconds. That's good. 
- Type Ctrl-3 (or search for "Aloha" in the Extras folder). 
  Instead of Hawaiian dancers, you will get some greetings from
  the End of the Universe ;-)

Enjoy...

PS: my big warm thanks go to Newt/0, Makoto Nukui and Paul Guyot,
with whom this would not have been possible. Also big thanks to
Simon Bell whose code gave my gearbox the desperatly needed kick.
