### Layout ###
> The layout contains information on what is in your application and how it behaves.
> You can roughly compare it to a floor plan: The bathroom (close box) is in the
> bottom right-hand corner, the closet (application title) is at the top, the
> living room (application content) is located between them. In the living room
> there is a TV set (checkbox) in the bottom left-hand corner, the opposite
> corner is occupied by the piano (date picker), and between both is a very
> large table (text input area). And so on...
> Every Newton project needs at least one layout file.

### Project File ###
> The project file is the container where all information required for compiling and
> building your package lives. This includes the build specifications (which you control
> in the DyneTK Project Settings) and a list of all files that are to be processed during
> compilation and build of your package.

### Template ###
> A template is a container that contains the data description of an object. Templates
> are, well, templates. Something pre-defined that you can use and adjust to your
> needs. Usually templates both control how views look and provide functionality
> required within the application.

### View ###
> A view is an object created by the Newton view system. It is a frame that represents
> a visual object on the screen. Every visible element of your
> application (in the above example the close box, the title, the checkbox,
> the date picker and the text input area) are views. The container around them,
> which you will soon create in the form of a ProtoFloatNGo, is a view, too.
> It is called the base view because it contains all the visual parts of
> the application.
