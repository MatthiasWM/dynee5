DyneTK lives with its users and its developers. I am very grateful for any support I can get. Please fill out an **Issue** form if you encounter crashes or bugs, or if you have an idea for a feature or suggestion.

Also, if you are interested in developing parts of DyneTK, I'd love to hear from you. Please contact me via EMail: DyneTKATmatthiasm.com
