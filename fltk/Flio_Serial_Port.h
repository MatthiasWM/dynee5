/**
 * A serial port communication widget for FLTK1.
 *
 * This widget manages communication over a serial port 
 * by providing a send and receive callback mechanism.
 * It draws indicators of the connection state, but the
 * Widget may as well stay hidden or not be part of a widget
 * tree at all.
 *
 * Line indicators are two LED-style circles tat are gray 
 * if the connection is closed, green if there is no data
 * sent or received, and red if there is traffic.
 *
 * We are using a 2kByte ring buffer to implement buffering.
 * If that seems to be too little, NRing in the constructor
 * can be changed accordingly.
 *
 * \todo We have yet to stress test the threading mechanism for multiple open/close operations!
 * \todo No buffer should be allocated until we actually open the line
 * \todo We should implement some better error handling
 * \todo We should provide an error message
 * \todo We could provide a tooltip indicating the number of bytes transmitted
