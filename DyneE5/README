========

DyneE5, a Newton PDA Emulator

DyneE5 is an OpenSource approach at emulating the Newton, the 
grandfather of all PDAs. To this day, the Newton is still one 
of the best and most intuitive PDAs with a surprisingly big 
following. DyneE5 is a purely educational project, helping to 
get a deeper understanding of this fascinating machine.


 Current Project State:
------------------------

Alpha, in every respect.


 Help Needed:
--------------

If you know how to code, please go ahead and fix bugs, add code,
add documentation. Heck, even replace ARMulator if you have 
something better! Let's make this thing finally boot!


 Developers:
-------------

You need to:
- download and install FLTK 1.1.7 (http://www.fltk.org/)
- download the Dyne sources
- kick of you gcc environment or VC6 (or later)
- DOWNLOAD THE ORIGINAL 8MB ROM CONTENTS FROM THE MP2100 
  THAT YOU OWN AND THAT YOU WISH TO EMULATE. Dyne does not
  contain any ROMs! Please don't ask us for the ROMs!
- run and experiment

The file dyne.fl contains the GUI. It should be edited using 
the user interface design tool "Fluid" that comes with FLTK.
