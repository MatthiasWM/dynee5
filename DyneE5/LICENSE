FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
UNIX®/Linux® (X11), Microsoft® Windows®, and MacOS® X. FLTK provides 
modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics 
via OpenGL® and its built-in GLUT emulation.

FLTK is designed to be small and modular enough to be statically 
linked, but works fine as a shared library. FLTK also includes an 
excellent UI builder called FLUID that can be used to create 
applications in minutes.

FLTK is provided under the terms of the GNU Library Public License, 
Version 2 with exceptions that allow for static linking.
