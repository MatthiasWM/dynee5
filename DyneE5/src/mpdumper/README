This is a simple utility I wrote to dump all the debug symbols from the Newton MP2K ROM image.

The ROM file can be found on UNNA and usually is called something like "Senior CirrusNoDebug image"

Generated symbols can also be demangled (-d switch) so the function names and signatures are clearly visible. The symbols can also be sorted by type,name (-n switch) or by value (-x switch). The output format could also be changed from default (name, value)to alternative (values, name) with -a switch. All switches have to be specified in one go so the following is invalid:

    bash$ mpdumper -d -x MP2100Image.aif >all_symbols_sorted.txt
    
instead it should be

    bash$ mpdumper -dx MP2100Image.aif >all_symbols_sorted.txt

For all command line options - please run utility without any parameters.

The utility was compiled and tested under Cygwin but I am sure it won't be difficult to update it to compile on other platforms (it uses POSIX API and standard C++ libraries). It uses modified parts from GNU Libiberty library for name demangling - those parts are covered by GPL version 2 license. The full source of modified parts as well as mpdumper are included.

Precompiled version of the utility is also included.

The couple of generated outputs of the MP2K debug ROM are also included (several .txt files).
