DyneE5 was going to be a Newton emulator, trying to be equal to the Apple Newton PDA.

The name DyneE5 is a word play on Newton. Just like the unit _Newton_, _[dyne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyne)_ is a physical unit of force.  These units can be converted:

_1 Newton = 1 kg·m/s<sup>2</sup> = 1·10<sup>5</sup> dyne_

or as we programmers would write

`1.0 N == 1.0E5 Dyne` - one Newton equals one DyneE5.
