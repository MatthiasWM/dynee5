# DyneTK, the Dyne Toolkit #

What's up with the name DyneE5?

## Introduction to Alienator ##

I uploaded code into the SVN archive named Alinator. It contains a target named "mosrun". mosrun simulates the Mac MPW environment and emulates CPU and RAM. mosrun can start the original MPW Newton Developer Tools on a modern Mac with Intel CPU and OS X (tested on 10.8).

The current version run ARM6asm pretty well, even though there are still some issues with file path conversion. The goal is to run **all** MPW Newton Tools as native OS X apps.

## Introduction to DyneTK ##

NewtonScript is a great programming language, and writing applications for the Newton can be a lot of fun. The original Newton developers IDE, NTK, has long been abandoned by Apple and will not work on OS X or Linux. The MS Windows version is also hardly usable due to a problematic serial line connection.

[DyneTK](DyneTK.md) strives to be a modernised and compatible IDE to NTK. [DyneTK](DyneTK.md) compiles and runs on all major platforms natively (Linux, OS X, MSWindows), supporting both MSWindows and Mac .ntk project files. It is currently powerful enough for writing small to medium applications, downloading them to a MessagePad or EInstein, and some light debugging.

[DyneTK](DyneTK.md) is OpenSource under GPL2 and can be modified and extended to support new features.
